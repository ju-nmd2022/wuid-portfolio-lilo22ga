        <h2>Things to do</h2>
        <p>
          Though I haven't lived here for very long yet, I still have a couple
          of tips on some very effortless and calm activities to do here in
          Jönköping.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>go on walks (there's so many nice trails here!)</li>
          <li>explore your surroundings on bike</li>
          <li>go to secondhands</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Things to eat</h2>
        <p>
          I can't say that I have that much knowledge about places to go eat
          either, life as a student.. BUT when I was at AKA last week, I had the
          vegetarian nuggets with garlic sauce, and they were *chefs kiss*. Only
          costs like 40 kronor too, luvs it!
