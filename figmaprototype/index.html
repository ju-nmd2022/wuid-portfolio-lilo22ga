          In this project us students were supposed to design a prototype for a
          streaming app. I chose to create a podcast app. As you can see I ended
          up with a darker color scheme, and quite calm colors aswell to make
          the layout easy on the eyes, but also to not take away attention from
          the nr 1 star here - the different podcasts! Reappearing in this
          design is also the usage of lines (and background boxes), this to
          emphasize where one section ends and another begins, all in all to
          make the whole thing easier to navigate through. The basic structure
          is inspired by similar streaming services, but it finds its own style
          through typeface, colors and details :)
