        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, My name is Lovisa Linder Lodén. I am 23 years old and come from
          Stockholm, Sweden. I have two siblings, a sister who is thirteen years
          older than me and a brother who is four years older than me. Despite
          the age gaps, they are like my best friends :) Before moving to JKPG I
          studied Graphic Design for a year which I found very enjoyable, in
          turn leading me in the direction of choosing...

        <h2>New Media Design</h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned, why I chose this program was partly because of the fact
          that I found Graphic Design very interesting and fun, but also because
          I wanted to get a broader picture of how design works behind the
          scenes, and getting to dabble in web development seemed like the
          perfect way to do that. All in all, I found New Media Design to be the
          perfect combo of two subjects that I wanted to learn more about.

        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          In my sparetime, I am usually either binge-watching a tv show,
          knitting, playing videogames or hanging out with friends (by playing
          videogames, I'm referring to The Sims and Cities Skylines hehe). I
          started knitting a couple of years ago, and it is by far the most
          calming and peaceful activity i know, which is needed I think! I'm
          also running out of shows to watch, so if anyone reading this has any
          tips, GIVE ME THEM (pls)
